First Steps
------------

* Check out the `course outline & goals <CourseInfo/index.html>`_

* Take me to the first topic!  `Reasoning <week1/reasoning.html>`_

* View the :ref:`t_o_c`


Material
----------  

Week 1 - Reasoning & Grit 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This week will get students excited/motivated & make them comfortable reasoning through code (by converting code to english).

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    week1/reasoning.rst
    week1/tenacity.rst


Week 2 - Enviroment & Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We'll make sure that students are comfortable and productive with their text editors and unix. Then we'll practice
using a methodical approach to debugging.

Week 3 - Collaboration & Git 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most programming doesn't happen alone - This week we'll go over strategies and tools to collaborate effectively. We'll be using a tool called Git - which can help you on your first group project. 

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    week3/questions.rst
    week3/partner.rst
    week3/git.rst


Week 4 - Reading Code 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A lot of programming is just reading code - this week we will practice skills to read & understand code. We'll also go over what makes for good style & how to use documentation.  

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    week4/index.rst
    week4/style.rst

Week 5 - Building Real Things 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is where the course ties everything backtogether and we learn how to build real things. We'll build a version of IBM's Watson supercomputer with just the skills we've learnt so far in our CS classes. This will also cover how to think of ideas for a project or startup. These skills will help you be able to make your own projects and eventually land an awesome internship or job.
