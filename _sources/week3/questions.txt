   Figure 1: Rubber Duck Using Piazza

Sometimes you actually need a response from an animate object. If you actually want a helpful response, it helps to provide the right information. 

Things to consider. 

#. Did you search for it first! 
	* This is a critical step. Why wait for a response when there is already one?
#. Where are you posting your question? 
	* Is it Piazza? StackOverflow? Email?
#. Don't just dump a question onto piazza and expect to have it sovled without effort on your part. 
	#. People like helping others who put in effort. 
#. Vauge questions get vauge answers.

The guideline for posting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Include the approriate details 
	#. Title: What is the issue. 
		* "It doesn't work" - isn't an issue. 
	#. If it crashes or errors. Include the entire error! 
		* Your test cases
		* The error message
		* What you think the error message means
		* What you think might have caused the error
	#. Explain the question in your own words so others can quickly understand it. 
		#. Often, you'll solve the issue or think of something as you are doing this. 
		#. Make sure to mention what you've tried.
		#. Screenshots and formatted code make it easier to understand
	#. Make it clear how someone can help you. 
	#. If you resolve it makes sure to help others who would have solved it.

	What makes a good question when it comes to a question. 

Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~

What looks easier to read? 

::

	def square(x):
		return x*x

	def sum_of_squares(x, y):
		return square(x) + square(y)
or 

def square(x):

return x * x

def sum_of_squares(x, y):

return square(x) + square(y)
