.. mchoicema:: question_git1
   :answer_a: Carrier Pigeons. Duh. 
   :answer_b: Email files back and forth and copy and paste. 
   :answer_c: Read the code alound while the other person copies it down. 
   :answer_d: Use a specialized tool that solves this exact problem and is used by millions of programmers 
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: Uh no.
   :feedback_b: That's really annoying though. 
   :feedback_c: Even if you had 100s of lines? 
   :feedback_d: Yes. That tool is called git!  

   How should multiple programmers work on the same file at the same time?

Demo
-------------------------

We're going to now work as a groups. Find two other people and practice commiting, pushing, and pulling. 


Commands
--------------------------

	#. git add – adds a file to the tracked files and stages it for commit

		#. Common use - git add "file.py" or git add * (To add everything)

	#. git status – shows you the current status of your repository (like changed / added / deleted files)

	#. git log – shows you the n last commit messages with some other data

	#. git commit – it will “save” current state of files locally, and prepare them for git push

		#. Common use - git commit -m 'Commit Message' or git commit -am 'Commit Messge'

	#. git push – it will collect all of your current commits that havent been commited and push them to remote repository

		#. Common use - Git push origin master

	#. git pull – combination of git fetch and git merge

		#. Common use - Git pull origin master

	#. git fetch – it fetches the remote changes to your local repository, but it doesn’t change your current source contents

	#. git merge – it’s used for merging 2 branches into one, if theres no need for 2 anymore

	#. git branch <new-branch-name> – creates a branch with name “new-branch-name”

	#. git diff – if you fetch the changes from remote, you can then see the difference between your code current version and last one on remote
