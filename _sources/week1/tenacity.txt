   :answer_a: Having started programming years ago. 
   :answer_b: Being a "genius"
   :answer_c: Knowing Python beforehand.
   :answer_d: None of the above. 
   :correct: d
   :feedback_a: While that might look like a huge advantage, it's not actually what's the most important.
   :feedback_b: Just being a 'genius' might seem like an advantage, you really learn programming through delibrate practice.
   :feedback_c: Just knowing the language will only be small advantage, it alone won't help you learn CS
   :feedback_d: Yup! It's tenacity & grit. This is probably true for a lot of other fields. 

   What do you think is the most important thing when it comes to learning Computer Science?
