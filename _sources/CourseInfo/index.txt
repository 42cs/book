Background
----------
Computer Science has a medium - programming.  Students who enter the CS curriculum without prior programming experience have to learn the medium of programming - with all of the associated tools - as well as the language of computer science taught in class. Often times, this leads students to feel like they are very far behind their peers - when in reality - there are a few practical skills and tools that will better equip them to focus on actually learning Computer Science in their CS classes. 

Audience
----------
This is useful for students who have little programming experience who might need a bit more guidance in starting out in programming than 61A can provide. Having a place to go to learn about the programming tools/workflow will significantly improve their ability to learn CS. 

Format
----------
-  Lab Based (Students will bring computers or we will meet in lab)
-  2-3 hours once a week.  

Objectives
----------
-  Teach the tacit skills (including soft skills) you (are supposed to) pick up going through 61A.

-  Be comfortable with programming tools like text editor, UNIX.

-  Providing a chance to get delibrate practice with the tools and methodologies.

Success Metrics
----------
These are metrics we need to measure to judge if the class is succesful. 

-	Students feel comfortable with their tools & programming attitudes. 

- 	Students feel that the time spent in class was useful:

	-	It directly saves them time in 61A 

	-	The things they learn help them understand CS61A Material

	-	Teaches them important skills that 61A doesn't have the time to teach

-	Students would reccomend the class


FAQ
-------------

-	Q: Do I have to officially enroll in the course on telebears: 

	A: Nope! We're piloting it this semester - so there are no units/grades for the course. 

-	Q: I can't make it for a particular week - can I still sign up?

	A: Yes! 

-	Q: I've been programming forever & feel comfortable with programming - should I take this class?

	A: This course is targeted at students without significant programming experience, so you won't get as much out of it. 

-	Q: Do I have to officially enroll in the course on telebears: 

	A: Nope! We're piloting it this semester - so there are no units/grades for the course. 

-	Q: Will students have extra work ontop of 61A? 

	A: No - we're aware of the workload so we won't toss extra work on the students. Everything they learn will be applicable to 61A and actually be a save stuents time.
